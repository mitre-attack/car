New executables that are started as a service are suspicious. This analytic looks for anomalous service executables.

## ATT&CK Detection

|Technique |Tactic |Level of Coverage |
|---|---|---|
|[Modify Existing Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1031/)|[Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003),[ Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004)|Moderate|
|[New Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1050/)|[Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003),[ Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004)|Moderate|

## Pseudocode
Create a baseline of services seen over the last 30 days and a list of services seen today. Remove services in the baseline from services seen today, leaving a list of new services.

```
processes = search Process:Create
services = filter processes where (parent_image_path == "C:\Windows\System32\services.exe")
historic_services = filter services (where timestamp < now - 1 day AND timestamp > now - 1 day)
current_services = filter services (where timestamp >= now - 1 day)
new_services = historic_services - current_services
output new_services
```
