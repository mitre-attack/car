Adversaries may modify the binary file for an existing service to achieve [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/beta/tactics/TA0003) while potentially [evading defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/beta/tactics/TA0005). If a newly created or modified runs as a service, it may indicate APT activity. However, services are frequently installed by legitimate software. A well-tuned baseline is essential to differentiating between benign and malicious service modifications.

### Output Description

The Service Name and approximate time in which changes occurred on each host

### Implementations

#### Pseudocode

Look for events where a file was created and then later run as a service. In these cases, a new service has been created or the binary has been modified. Many programs, such as `msiexec.exe`, do these behaviors legitimately and can be used to help validate legitimate service creations/modifications.


```
legitimate_installers = ["C:\windows\system32\msiexec.exe", "C:\windows\syswow64\msiexec.exe", ...]

file_change = search File:Create,Modify
process = search Process:Create
service_process = filter processes where (parent_exe == "services.exe")
modified_service = join (search, filter) where (
 file_change.time < service_process.time and 
 file_change.file_path == service_process.image_path
)

modified_service = filter modified_service where (modified_service.file_change.image_path not in legitimate_installers)
output modified_service
```
