A remote desktop logon, through [RDP](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1076/), may be typical of a system administrator or IT support, but only from select workstations. Monitoring remote desktop logons and comparing to known/approved originating systems can detect lateral movement of an adversary.


### ATT&CK Detection

|Technique|Tactic|Level of Coverage|
|---|---|---|
|[Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1076/)|[Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/)|Moderate|


### Implementations

#### Pseudocode

Look in the system logs for remote logons using RDP.


```
[EventCode] == 4624 and
[AuthenticationPackageName] == 'Negotiate' and
[Severity] == "Information" and
[LogonType] == 10
```


#### Sigma

[Sigma version](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/win_admin_rdp_login.yml) of the above pseudocode, with some modifications.
