New executables that are started as a service are suspicious. This analytic looks for anomalous service executables.


### ATT&CK Detection

|Technique|Subtechnique(s)|Tactic(s)|Level of Coverage|
|---|---|---|---|
|[Create or Modify System Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/)|[Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003/)|[Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/)|Moderate|

### Data Model References

|Object|Action|Field|
|---|---|---|
|[process](/data_model/process) | [create](/data_model/process#create) | [parent_image_path](/data_model/process#parent_image_path) |


### Implementations

#### Pseudocode

Create a baseline of services seen over the last 30 days and a list of services seen today. Remove services in the baseline from services seen today, leaving a list of new services.


```
processes = search Process:Create
services = filter processes where (parent_image_path == "C:\Windows\System32\services.exe")
historic_services = filter services (where timestamp < now - 1 day AND timestamp > now - 1 day)
current_services = filter services (where timestamp >= now - 1 day)
new_services = historic_services - current_services
output new_services
```
