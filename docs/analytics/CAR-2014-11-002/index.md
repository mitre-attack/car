Many programs create command prompts as part of their normal operation including malware used by attackers. This analytic attempts to identify suspicious programs spawning `cmd.exe` by looking for programs that do not normally create `cmd.exe`.

While this analytic does not take the user into account, doing so could generate further interesting results. 
It is very common for some programs to spawn cmd.exe as a subprocess, for example to run batch files or windows commands. However many process don’t routinely launch a command prompt – for example Microsoft Outlook. A command prompt being launched from a process that normally doesn’t launch command prompts could be the result of malicious code being injected into that process, or of an attacker replacing a legitimate program with a malicious one.


### Output Description

The time and host the new process was started as well as its parent

### Data Model References

|Object|Action|Field|

|[process](/data_model/process) | [create](/data_model/process#create) | [parent_exe](/data_model/process#parent_exe) |


### Implementations

#### Pseudocode

Create a baseline of parents of `cmd.exe` seen over the last 30 days and a list of parents of `cmd.exe` seen today. Remove parents in the baseline from parents seen today, leaving a list of new parents.


```
processes = search Process:Create
cmd = filter processes where (exe == "cmd.exe")
cmd = from cmd select parent_exe
historic_cmd = filter cmd (where timestamp < now - 1 day AND timestamp > now - 1 day)
current_cmd = filter cmd (where timestamp >= now - 1 day)
new_cmd = historic_cmd - current_cmd
output new_cmd
```
