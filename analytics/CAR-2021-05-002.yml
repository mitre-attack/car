- description: You must be ingesting data that records the file-system activity from
    your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data-model node. If you are using
    Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
    you want to collect data.
  code: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(Filesystem.dest)
    as dest values(Filesystem.file_name) as file_name values(Filesystem.user) as user
