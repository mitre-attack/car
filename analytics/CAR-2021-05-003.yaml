description: This search looks for flags passed to bcdedit.exe modifications to the
  built-in Windows error recovery boot configurations. This is typically used by ransomware
  to prevent recovery.

  description: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity, including
    parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint data model
    in the Processes node. Tune based on parent process names.
