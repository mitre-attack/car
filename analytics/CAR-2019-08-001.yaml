  The Windows Task Manager may be used to dump the memory space of `lsass.exe` to disk for processing with a credential access tool such as Mimikatz. This is performed by launching Task Manager as a privileged user, selecting `lsass.exe`, and clicking "Create dump file". This saves a dump file to disk with a deterministic name that includes the name of the process being dumped.

  This requires filesystem data to determine whether files have been created.
