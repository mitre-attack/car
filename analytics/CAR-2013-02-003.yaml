description: 'The Windows [Command Prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cmd.exe) (`cmd.exe`) is a utility that provides a command line interface to Windows operating systems. It provides the ability to run additional programs and also has several built-in commands such as `dir`, `copy`, `mkdir`, and `type`, as well as batch scripts (`.bat`). Typically, when a user runs a command prompt, the parent process is `explorer.exe` or another instance of the prompt. There may be automated programs, logon scripts, or administrative tools that launch instances of the command prompt in order to run scripts or other built-in commands. Spawning the process `cmd.exe` from certain parents may be more indicative of malice. For example, if Adobe Reader or Outlook launches a command shell, this may suggest that a malicious document has been loaded and should be investigated. Thus, by looking for abnormal parent processes of `cmd.exe`, it may be possible to detect adversaries.'
