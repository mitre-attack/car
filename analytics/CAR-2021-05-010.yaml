  description: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
    hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also
    be ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
    The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
    model.
