implementations:
- description: This search needs Sysmon Logs with a Sysmon configuration, which includes
    EventCode 8 with lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`. We
    strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations (index,
    source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition
    with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
    macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  code: '`sysmon` EventID=8 TargetImage=*lsass.exe | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
    max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, EventCode, TargetImage, TargetProcessId |
    rename Computer as dest'
