description: |-
  According to [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/), [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086/) can be used over WinRM to remotely run commands on a host. When a remote PowerShell session starts, svchost.exe executes wsmprovhost.exe

  For this to work, certain registry keys must be set, and the WinRM service must be enabled. The PowerShell command `Enter-PSSession -ComputerName \<RemoteHost\>` creates a remote PowerShell session.
