description: CertUtil.exe may be used to `encode` and `decode` a file, including PE
  and script code. Encoding will convert a file to base64 with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`
  and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` tags. Malicious usage will include decoding a encoded
  file that was downloaded. Once decoded, it will be loaded by a parallel process.
  Note that there are two additional command switches that may be used - `encodehex`
  and `decodehex`. Similarly, the file will be encoded in HEX and later decoded for
  further execution. During triage, identify the source of the file being decoded.
  Review its contents or execution behavior for further analysis.

implementations:
- description: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
    on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
    your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
  code: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
    where Processes.process_name=certutil.exe Processes.process=*decode* by Processes.dest
    Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process
    Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id'
