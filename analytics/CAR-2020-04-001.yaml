  The Windows [Volume Shadow Copy Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service) is a built-in OS feature that can be used to create backup copies of files and volumes.

  Adversaries may delete these shadow copies, typically through the usage of system utilities such as vssadmin.exe or wmic.exe, in order prevent file and data recovery. This technique is commonly employed for this purpose by ransomware.
