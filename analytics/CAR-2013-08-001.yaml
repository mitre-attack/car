description: 'The Windows built-in tool `schtasks.exe` provides the creation, modification, and running of [scheduled tasks](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053) on a local or remote computer. It is provided as a more flexible alternative to `at.exe`, described in [CAR-2013-05-004](../CAR-2013-05-004). Although used by adversaries, the tool is also legitimately used by administrators, scripts, and software configurations. The scheduled tasks tool can be used to gain [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) and can be used in combination with a [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) technique to remotely gain [execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002). Additionally, the command has parameters to specify the user and password responsible for creating the task, as well as the user and password combination that the task will run as. The `/s` flag specifies the remote system on which the task should be scheduled, usually indicating [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008).'

      Create a new scheduled task with schtasks.exe and verify the analytic fires when the task executes.
      * From an admin account, open Windows command prompt (right click, run as administrator)
      * Execute `schtasks /Create /SC ONCE /ST 19:00 /TR C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe /TN calctask`, substituting a time in the near future for 19:00
      * The program should respond with “SUCCESS: The scheduled task “calctask” has successfully been created.”
      * The program should execute at the time specified. This is what the analytic should fire on.
      * To remove the scheduled task, execute `schtasks /Delete /TN calctask`.
      * The program should respond with “SUCCESS: The scheduled task “calctask” was successfully deleted.”
    commands:
      - 'schtasks /Create /SC ONCE /ST 19:00 /TR C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe /TN calctask'
      - schtasks /Delete /TN calctask
