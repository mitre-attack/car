description: While batch files are not inherently malicious, it is uncommon to see them created after OS installation, especially in the Windows directory. This analytic looks for the suspicious activity of a batch file being created within the C:\Windows\System32 directory tree. There will be only occasional false positives due to administrator actions.

      batch_files = filter files where (
        extension =".bat" AND file_path = "C:\Windows\system32*" )

  description: You must be ingesting data that records the file-system activity from
    your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data-model node. If you are using
    Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
    you want to collect data.
  code: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(Filesystem.dest)
    as dest values(Filesystem.file_name) as file_name values(Filesystem.user) as user
    from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem by Filesystem.file_path   | rex field=file_name
    "(?<file_extension>\.[^\.]+)$" | search file_path=*system32* AND file_extension=.bat'
