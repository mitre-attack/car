description: |-
  Adversaries may modify the binary file for an existing service to achieve [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) while potentially [evading defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005). If a newly created or modified runs as a service, it may indicate APT activity. However, services are frequently installed by legitimate software. A well-tuned baseline is essential to differentiating between benign and malicious service modifications.

  ### Output Description

  The Service Name and approximate time in which changes occurred on each host

Many programs, such as `msiexec.exe`, do these behaviors legitimately and can be used to help validate legitimate service creations/modifications.'
