  An SMB write can be an indicator of lateral movement, especially when combined with other information such as execution of that written file. Named pipes are a subset of SMB write requests. Named pipes such as msftewds may not be alarming; however others, such as lsarpc, may.

  Monitoring SMB write requests still creates some noise, particulary with named pipes. As a result, SMB is now split between writing named pipes and writing other files.

      Look for SMB network connections over port 445. Using a sensor that can decode protocol information, extract out the name of the pipe and potentially other information. This happens legitimately so certain pipes, such as `spoolss` should be appropriately white-listed. Certain pipes do correspond to adversary activity, including:

      * `WINREG` - Windows Remote Registry ([CAR-2014-11-005](../CAR-2014-11-005))
      * `ATSVC` - Windows AT command ([CAR-2015-04-001](../CAR-2015-04-001))

        flow = search Flow:Message
        smb_write = filter flow where (dest_port == "445" and protocol == "smb.write_pipe")
        smb_write.pipe_name = smb_write.proto_info.pipe_name
        output smb_write
