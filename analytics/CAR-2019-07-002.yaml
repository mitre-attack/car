  [ProcDump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump) is a sysinternal command-line utility whose primary purpose is monitoring an application for CPU spikes and generating crash dumps during a spike that an administrator or developer can use to determine the cause of the spike. 

  ProcDump may be used to dump the memory space of lsass.exe to disk for processing with a credential access tool such as Mimikatz. This is performed by launching procdump.exe as a privileged user with command line options indicating that lsass.exe should be dumped to a file with an arbitrary name.

  Note - the CAR data model currently does not support process access actions, so the pseudocode implementation is based around process creates.

    description: This base pseudocode looks for process create events where an instance of procdump is executed that references lsass in the command-line.

        exe = "procdump*.exe"  and
