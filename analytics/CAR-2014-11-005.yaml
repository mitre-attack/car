description: |-
  An adversary can remotely [manipulate the registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112) of another machine if the RemoteRegistry service is enabled and valid credentials are obtained. While the registry is remotely accessed, it can be used to prepare a [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) technique, [discover](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007) the configuration of a host, achieve [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003), or anything that aids an adversary in achieving the mission. Like most ATT&CK techniques, this behavior can be used legitimately, and the reliability of an analytic depends on the proper identification of the pre-existing legitimate behaviors. Although this behavior is disabled in many Windows configurations, it is possible to [remotely enable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002) the RemoteRegistry service, which can be detected with [CAR-2014-03-005](../CAR-2014-03-005).

  Remote access to the registry can be achieved via

  -   Windows API function [RegConnectRegistry](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724840.aspx)
  -   command line via `reg.exe`
  -   graphically via `regedit.exe`
  
  All of these behaviors call into the Windows API, which uses the NamedPipe `WINREG` over SMB to handle the protocol information. This network can be decoded with wireshark or a similar sensor, and can also be detected by hooking the API function.
