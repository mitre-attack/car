fields:
  - name: authentication_lan_package_name
    description: The name of the LAN Manager sub-package (NTLM-family protocol name) that was used during logon. Possible values are: NTLM V1, NTLM V2, LM. Only populated if Authentication Package = NTLM.
    example: ''
  - name: authentication_package_name
    description: The name of the authentication package which was used for the logon authentication process. Default packages loaded on LSA startup are located in “HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig” registry key. Other packages can be loaded at runtime. When a new package is loaded a “4610: An authentication package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority” (typically for NTLM) or “4622: A security package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority” (typically for Kerberos) event is logged to indicate that a new package has been loaded along with the package name.
    example: Negotiate
  - name: device_claims
    description: list of device claims for new logon session
    example: ''
  - name: elevated_token
    description: >-
    a “Yes” or “No” flag. If “Yes” then the session this event represents is
    elevated and has administrator privileges.
    example: '%%1842'
  - name: impersonation_level
    description: ''
    example: '%%1833'
  - name: key_length
    description: >-
    the length of NTLM Session Security key. Typically it has 128 bit or 56 bit
    length. This parameter is always 0 if “Authentication Package” = “Kerberos”,
    because it is not applicable for Kerberos protocol. This field will also
    have “0” value if Kerberos was negotiated using Negotiate authentication
    package.
    example: '0'
  - name: login_id
    description: A hex value corresponding to the session. The login id will persist until
    logout occurs.
    example: '0xf61f3'
  - name: login_successful
    description: Boolean indicator of whether a login attempt was successful.
    example: 'FALSE'
  - name: login_type
    description: The type of login that was accomplished or attempted.
    example: |-
    interactive
    ,local
    ,rdp
    ,remote
  - name: process_name
    description: The name of the trusted logon process that was used for the logon. See event “4611: A trusted logon process has been registered with the Local Security Authority” description for more information.
    example: User32
  - name: restricted_admin_mode
    description: >-
    Only populated for RemoteInteractive logon type sessions. This is a Yes/No
    flag indicating if the credentials provided were passed using Restricted
    Admin mode. Restricted Admin mode was added in Win8.1/2012R2 but this flag
    was added to the event in Win10. If not a RemoteInteractive logon, then this
    will be “-” string.
    example: ''
  - name: transmitted_services
    description: >-
    the list of transmitted services. Transmitted services are populated if the
    logon was a result of a S4U (Service For User) logon process. S4U is a
    Microsoft extension to the Kerberos Protocol to allow an application service
    to obtain a Kerberos service ticket on behalf of a user - most commonly done
    by a front-end website to access an internal resource on behalf of a user.
    example: ''
  - name: user_claims
    description: >-
    list of user claims for new logon session. This field contains user claims
    if user account was logged in and device claims if computer account was
    logged in
    example: >-
    ad://ext/cn:88d2b96fdb2b4c49 <%%1818> : "dadmin"
    ad://ext/Department:88d16a8edaa8c66b <%%1818> : "IT”
  - name: user_linked_id
    description: >-
    A hexadecimal value of the paired logon session. If there is no other logon
    session associated with this logon session, then the value is “0x0”.
    example: '0x0'
  - name: virtual_account
    description: >-
    a “Yes” or “No” flag, which indicates if the account is a virtual account
    (e.g., “Managed Service Account”), which was introduced in Windows 7 and
    Windows Server 2008 R2 to provide the ability to identify the account that a
    given Service uses, instead of just using “NetworkService”.
    example: '%%1843'
