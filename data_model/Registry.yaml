name: Windows Registry
  - name: hive_path
    description: >-
    The logical group of keys, subkeys, and values in the registry that has a
    set of supporting files loaded into memory when the operating system is
    started or a user logs in.
    example: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM
  - name: key
    description: >-
    This field contains the key name without the full path. Take in
    consideration the name of the key value in the registry key path. Similar to
    a folder in a traditional file system
    example: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\RpcSs
  - name: key_access_rights
    description: >-
    The Windows security model enables you to control access to registry keys.
    The valid access rights for registry keys include the DELETE, READ_CONTROL,
    WRITE_DAC, and WRITE_OWNER standard access rights. Registry keys do not
    support the SYNCHRONIZE standard access right.
    example: KEY_ALL_ACCESS (0xF003F)
  - name: key_path

    Next-level down from registry root-keys. This field contains the full path
    of a registry key. This is a combination of the root key, hive, key,
    sub-key, and value. A key is a folder in the registry that contain other
    sub-keys.
    example: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\WardogPersistence
  - name: new_content
    description: >-
    The data within the new value, or the new name of a key or value, after an
    edit event.
    example: >-
    \%SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe,
    HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\RpcSs
  - name: root_key
    description: >-
    Root-Keys are the root, or primary divisions, of the registry. They do not
    contain configuration data; they contain the keys, subkeys, and values in
    which the data is stored. There are six root keys (HKCU, HKU, HKCR, HKLM,
    HKCC and HKPD) that store information related to currently looged on users,
    local accounts, performance, and even the current hardware profile. Root-key
    names represent Windows handles (H) to Keys (K).
    example: HKLM or HKEY_LOCAL_MAHINE
  - name: value_data
    description: >-
    Each registry key value consists of a value name and its associated data.
    Registry key value data store the actual configuration data for the
    operating system and the programs that run on the system. As such, they are
    different from subtrees, keys, and subkeys, which are merely containers.
    example: '%SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe -k rpcss'
  - name: value_name
    description: >-
    Registry values are the lowest-level element in the registry. They appear in
    the right pane of the registry editor window. Each entry consists of the
    value name, its Data Types in the Registry (which defines the length and
    format of data that the entry can store), and a field known as the data of
    the registry value. These are also known as registry entries. This field
    contains the key value name without the full registry key path.
    example: InstalledVersion
  - name: value_type
    description: >-
    values store different kinds of data such as REG_NONE (No value type),
    REG_SZ (Fixed-length Unicode string), REG_EXPAND_SZ (Variable-length Unicode
    string that can have embedded environment variables), etc. Types include
    binary data, 32 bit numbers, strings, etc.
    example: |-
    REG_SZ
    ,REG_MULTI_SZ
    ,REG_DWORD
    ,REG_BINARY
    ,REG_QWORD
    ,REG_EXPAND_SZ
