name: Module
description: Modules correspond to executable (and potentially non-executable) content, and are loaded as a contiguous region of memory into the address space of a process. Each process will have the main image loaded as a module and shared libraries (DLLs in Windows) and their dependencies.
actions:
  - name: load
    description: A module load event occurs when a PE image (dll or exe) is loaded into a process.
  - name: unload
    description: When the module is unloaded from memory, upon destruction of the process or by calling an API such as FreeLibrary, the unload event is triggered.
fields:
  - name: fqdn
    description: The fully qualified domain name of the host. Contains the hostname appended with the domain.
    example: HOST1.EXAMPLE_DOMAIN.COM
  - name: hostname
    description: The hostname of the host, without the domain.
    example: HOST1
  - name: base_address
    description: A hex address indicating where the module is loaded into the process’s virtual address space.
    example: 0xFFFFF8000405F000
  - name: image_path
    description: The file system location of the process image.
    example: C:\path\to\example.exe
  - name: md5_hash
    description: The MD5 hash of the contents of the file located at `module_path`. The field is in hex notation, without the 0x prefix.
    example: 5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3
  - name: sha1_hash
    description: The SHA1 hash of the contents of the file located at `image_path`.
    example: 2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed
  - name: sha256_hash
    description: The SHA256 hash of the contents of the file located at `image_path`.
    example: 68e656b251e67e8358bef8483ab0d51c6619f3e7a1a9f0e75838d41ff368f728
  - name: module_path
    description: The full file system path to the module loaded into the memory space of the process.
    example: C:\windows\system32\kernel32.exe
  - name: module_name
    description: The name of the file where the module is loaded on disk. This is also the string that is used internally by the program to lookup information about the module.
    example: kernel32.exe
  - name: pid
    description: Process ID of the process in which the module is loaded (or unloaded).
    example: 738
  - name: signer
    description: The name of the organization which signed the module.
    example: Microsoft Corporation
  - name: tid
    description: The thread ID of the thread responsible for the load or unload event.
    example: 50
  - name: signature_valid
    description: Boolean indicator of whether the signature is current and not revoked
    example: true
