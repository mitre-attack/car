	# 1- SumStats Analytics for ATT&CK Lateral Movement and Execution
	#
	# Description:
	#    Use SumStats to raise a Bro/Zeek Notice event if an SMB Lateral Movement
	#    indicator (e.g., SMB File Write to a Windows Admin File Share: ADMIN$ or
	#    C$ only) is observed together with a DCE-RPC Execution indicator against
	#    the same (targeted) host, within a specified period of time.
	#
	# Relevant ATT&CK Technique(s):
	#    T1077 Windows Admin Shares (file shares only, not named pipes) &&
	#    T1105 Remote File Copy && (T1035 Service Execution || T1047 WMI || T1053 Scheduled Task)
	#
	# Relevant Indicator(s) Detected by Bro/Zeek:
	#    (a) smb1_write_andx_response::c$smb_state$path contains ADMIN$ or C$
	#    (b) smb2_write_request::c$smb_state$path contains ADMIN$ or C$ *
	#    (c) dce_rpc_response::c$dce_rpc$endpoint + c$dce_rpc$operation contains
	#        any of the following: (see BZAR::rpc_execution set).
	#
	# NOTE: Preference would be to detect 'smb2_write_response'
	#       event (instead of 'smb2_write_request'), because it
	#       would confirm the file was actually written to the
	#       remote destination.  Unfortuantely, Bro/Zeek does
	#       not have an event for that SMB message-type yet.

	# 2- SumStats Analytics for ATTACK Lateral Movement (Multiple Attempts)
	#
	# Description:

	#    Movement indicators (e.g., multiple attempts to connect to a Windows Admin
	#    File Share: ADMIN$ or C$ only) are observed originating from the same host,
	#    regardless of write-attempts and regardless of whether or not any connection
	#    is successful --just connection attempts-- within a specified period of time.
	#
	# Relevant ATT&CK Technique(s):
	#    T1077 Windows Admin Shares (file shares only, not named pipes)
	#
	# Relevant Indicator(s) Detected by Bro/Zeek:
	#    (a) smb1_tree_connect_andx_request::c$smb_state$path contains ADMIN$ or C$

	#    within a specified period of time.
